# HTML Notes

## Introduction to HTML5 Elements

HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. These include main, header, footer, nav, video, article, section and others.

These tags give a descriptive structure to your HTML, make your HTML easier to read, and help with Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and accessibility. The main HTML5 tag helps search engines and other developers find the main content of your page.

Example usage, a main element with two child elements nested inside it:

```
<main> 
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>Hello Paragraph</p>
</main>
```

>Note: Many of the new HTML5 tags and their benefits are covered in the Applied Accessibility section.

## Add Placeholder Text to a Text Field

Placeholder text is what is displayed in your input element before your user has inputted anything.

You can create placeholder text like so:

```
<input type="text" placeholder="this is placeholder text">
```

>Note: Remember that input elements are self-closing.
